# Chapter 6. Conclusion And Future Work

### Conclusion

With respect to the large proportion of users on Web are mobile users [呼应开头], the mobile Web App ...... 

Our App is lightweight compared with traditional native Apps since it is based on Web.

- Better performance
- More functionalities (native APIs)



### Future Work

Traditional Web Apps and native Apps can be merged to some extend. They are called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Since our project uses Android Web View, most of functionalities are based on Web. It is not available offline and it requires users' installation in order to be used. However, we can extend our app to a PWA: make it an installable Web App. So that, the users can use our Web App normally without network connection [1]. Moreover, the user is able to access our App both with installation from the App Store or downloaded browser [2]. So that the performance and functionality will increase while keeping the accessibility and reliability unaffected.
